  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with groups
  So that those groups can access the files and folders

  Scenario Outline: sharing  files and folder with an internal problematic group name
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | user1    |
      | user2    |
      | user3    |
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname |
      | <group>   |
    And user "user1" has been added to group "<group>"
    And user "user2" has been added to group "<group>"
    And user "user3" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with group "<group>" using the webUI
    And the user shares file "testimage.jpg" with group "<group>" using the webUI
    And the user re-logs in as "user1" using the webUI
    Then folder "simple-folder (2)" should be listed on the webUI
    And folder "simple-folder (2)" should be marked as shared with "<group>" by "User Three" on the webUI
    And file "testimage (2).jpg" should be listed on the webUI
    And file "testimage (2).jpg" should be marked as shared with "<group>" by "User Three" on the webUI
    When the user re-logs in as "user2" using the webUI
    Then folder "simple-folder (2)" should be listed on the webUI
    And folder "simple-folder (2)" should be marked as shared with "<group>" by "User Three" on the webUI
    And file "testimage (2).jpg" should be listed on the webUI
    And file "testimage (2).jpg" should be marked as shared with "<group>" by "User Three" on the webUI
    Examples:
      | group     |
      | ?\?@#%@,; |
      | नेपाली    |
