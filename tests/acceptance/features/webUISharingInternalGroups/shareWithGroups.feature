Feature: Sharing files and folders with internal groups
  As a user
  I want to share files and folders with groups
  So that those groups can access the files and folders

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | user1    |
      | user2    |
      | user3    |
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname |
      | grp1      |
    And user "user1" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "user2" has been added to group "grp1"

  Scenario Outline: share a file & folder with another internal user
    Given user "user3" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with group "grp1" as "<set-role>" using the webUI
    And the user shares file "testimage.jpg" with group "grp1" as "<set-role>" using the webUI
    Then group "grp1" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And group "grp1" should be listed as "<expected-role>" in the collaborators list for file "testimage.jpg" on the webUI
    And user "user1" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value                |
      | uid_owner   | user3                |
      | share_with  | grp1                 |
      | file_target | /simple-folder (2)   |
      | item_type   | folder               |
      | permissions | <permissions-folder> |
    And user "user2" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value              |
      | uid_owner   | user3              |
      | share_with  | grp1               |
      | file_target | /testimage (2).jpg |
      | item_type   | file               |
      | permissions | <permissions-file> |
    And as "user1" these resources should be listed on the webUI
      | entry_name        |
      | simple-folder (2) |
      | testimage (2).jpg |
    And these resources should be listed in the folder "simple-folder (2)" on the webUI
      | entry_name |
      | lorem.txt  |
    But these resources should not be listed in the folder "simple-folder (2)" on the webUI
      | entry_name        |
      | simple-folder (2) |
    #    And folder "simple-folder (2)" should be marked as shared by "User Two" on the webUI
    #    And file "testimage (2).jpg" should be marked as shared by "User Two" on the webUI
    Examples:
      | set-role             | expected-role | permissions-folder         | permissions-file |
      | Viewer               | Viewer        | read                       | read             |
      | Editor               | Editor        | read,update,create, delete | read,update      |
      | Advanced permissions | Viewer        | read                       | read             |

  Scenario: share a file with an internal group a member overwrites and unshares the file
    Given user "user3" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user renames file "lorem.txt" to "new-lorem.txt" using the webUI
    And the user shares file "new-lorem.txt" with group "grp1" using the webUI
    And the user re-logs in as "user1" using the webUI
    Then the content of "new-lorem.txt" should not be the same as the local "new-lorem.txt"
    # overwrite the received shared file
    When the user uploads overwriting file "new-lorem.txt" using the webUI and retries if the file is locked
    Then file "new-lorem.txt" should be listed on the webUI
    And the content of "new-lorem.txt" should be the same as the local "new-lorem.txt"
    # unshare the received shared file
    When the user unshares file "new-lorem.txt" using the webUI
    Then file "new-lorem.txt" should not be listed on the webUI
    # check that another group member can still see the file
    When the user re-logs in as "user2" using the webUI

    When the user re-logs in as "user3" using the webUI
    Then the content of "new-lorem.txt" should be the same as the local "new-lorem.txt"
