Feature: Sharing files and folders with multiple internal users with different permissions
  As a user
  I want to set different permissions on shared files and folders with other users
  So that I can control the access on those files/folders by other collaborators

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | user1    |
      | user2    |

  Scenario Outline: share a folder with multiple users with different roles and permissions
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | user0    |
      | user3    |
      | user4    |
    And user "user1" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user opens the share dialog for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI
    And the user opens the share creation dialog in the webUI
    And the user selects the following collaborators for the share as "<role>" with "<extra-permissions>" permissions:
      | collaborator | type |
      | Regular User | user |
      | User Two     | user |
      | User Three   | user |
      | User Four    | user |
    And the user removes "User Four" as a collaborator from the share
    And the user removes "Regular User" as a collaborator from the share
    And the user shares with the selected collaborators
    Then custom permissions "<displayed-permissions>" should be set for user "User Two" for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And custom permissions "<displayed-permissions>" should be set for user "User Three" for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And user "User Two" should be listed as "<displayed-role>" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And user "User Three" should be listed as "<displayed-role>" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
    And user "user2" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value                |
      | uid_owner   | user1                |
      | share_with  | user2                |
      | file_target | /simple-folder (2)   |
      | item_type   | folder               |
      | permissions | <actual-permissions> |
    And user "user3" should have received a share with these details:
      | field       | value                |
      | uid_owner   | user1                |
      | share_with  | user3                |
      | file_target | /simple-folder (2)   |
      | item_type   | folder               |
      | permissions | <actual-permissions> |
    But user "Regular User" should not be listed in the collaborators list on the webUI
    And as "user0" folder "simple-folder (2)" should not exist
    And user "User Four" should not be listed in the collaborators list on the webUI
    And as "user4" folder "simple-folder (2)" should not exist
