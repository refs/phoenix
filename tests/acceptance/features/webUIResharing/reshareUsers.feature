Feature: Resharing shared files with different permissions
  As a user
  I want to reshare received files and folders with other users with different permissions
  So that I can control the access on those files/folders by other collaborators

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | user1    |
      | user2    |
      | user3    |

  Scenario: Reshare a folder without share permissions using API and check if it is listed on the collaborators list for original owner
      Given user "user2" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "user1" with "read, share" permissions
      And user "user1" has shared folder "simple-folder (2)" with user "user3" with "read" permissions
      And user "user2" has logged in using the webUI
      When the user opens the share dialog for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI
      Then user "User Three" should be listed as "Viewer" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI
      And no custom permissions should be set for collaborator "User Three" for folder "simple-folder" on the webUI

  Scenario: Reshare a folder without share permissions using API and check if it is listed on the collaborators list for resharer
      Given user "user2" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "user1" with "read, share" permissions
      And user "user1" has shared folder "simple-folder (2)" with user "user3" with "read" permissions
      And user "user1" has logged in using the webUI
      When the user opens the share dialog for folder "simple-folder (2)" using the webUI
      Then user "User Three" should be listed as "Viewer" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder (2)" on the webUI
      And no custom permissions should be set for collaborator "User Three" for folder "simple-folder (2)" on the webUI

  Scenario: Reshare a folder without share permissions using API and check if the receiver can reshare
    Given user "user2" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "user1" with "read, share" permissions
    And user "user1" has shared folder "simple-folder (2)" with user "user3" with "read" permissions
    When user "user3" logs in using the webUI
    Then the user should not be able to share folder "simple-folder (2)" using the webUI

  Scenario Outline: share a received folder with another user with same permissions(including share permissions) and check if the user is displayed in collaborators list for resharer
    Given user "user2" has shared folder "simple-folder" with user "user1" with "<permissions>" permissions
    And user "user1" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder (2)" with user "User Three" as "<role>" with permissions "<collaborators-permissions>" using the webUI
    Then user "User Three" should be listed as "<displayed-role>" in the collaborators list for folder "simple-folder (2)" on the webUI
    And custom permissions "<displayed-permissions>" should be set for user "User Three" for folder "simple-folder (2)" on the webUI
    And user "user3" should have received a share with these details:
    | field       | value              |
    | uid_owner   | user1              |
    | share_with  | user3              |
    | file_target | /simple-folder (2) |
    | item_type   | folder             |
    | permissions | <permissions>      |
